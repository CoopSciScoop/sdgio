def: "A flash flood is a flood formed by the rapid flooding of geomorphic low-lying areas. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may also occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam. Flash floods are distinguished from a regular flood by a timescale of less than six hours." [Adapted from Wikipedia:Flash_flood]
